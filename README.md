# 🐝 HoneyDrunk Studios — Hive Operations Manifest v4.0  
*(HoneyDrunk.OS • The Grid • Build-in-Public Cyberpunk Edition)*  

(Founder-Controlled • AI-Advised • Copilot-Powered • Cyberpunk-Aesthetic • Build-in-Public • Agentic-Driven)  

---

## 🎯 Mission
**Build the HoneyDrunk Grid** — interlinked systems, SDKs, creative tools, embodied agents, and original games that feel handcrafted, alive, and deliberate.  
Internally, this network operates as **HoneyDrunk.OS** — the operating system powering every Node and agent.  

> **Structure meets soul. Code meets art.**

---

## 💡 Public-First Philosophy
HoneyDrunk is a **build-in-public studio**. Each Node is both **system** and **story**.  
**Public Name:** *The Grid* | **Internal System Name:** *HoneyDrunk.OS*  

> Externally = *The Grid* (mythos + map)  
> Internally = *HoneyDrunk.OS* (runtime + architecture)

---

## 🧮 Cost Discipline Protocol
Follow the **Zero-Bloat Directive.**  
Azure free tiers · Static sites · Central YAMLs · Open-source tooling.  
> **Cost is a design constraint, not a limitation.**

Covers all games under HoneyDrunk — visual novels, sims, strategy, sandbox, and experimental AI titles.

### 🦾 Cyberware — Robotics & Embodied Systems
> “Where code meets matter.”  
Advanced robotics, simulation, and embodied AI agents powered by Vault, Pulse, and Transport.  
Cyberware covers both **HoneyMech’s** legacy mission and new embodied-tech Nodes.

### 🔐 HoneyNet — Security & Defense Sector
> “Run the sim. Guard the Hive.”  
Security research, SDKs, and experiments in resilience.  
Home to **BreachLab.exe** (white-hat experimental labs) and **HoneySentinel** (secure-by-default SDK).  
Connected to **Vault** and **Pulse** for secrets management and telemetry.

## 🤖 AI Integration Directive
AI is the **neural fabric** of HoneyDrunk.OS.  
Agents amplify creators and automate flow.

| Class | Function |
|-------|-----------|
| Strategic | Long-term planning + node coordination |
| Operational | CI/CD, documentation, testing |
| Creative | Asset + narrative generation |
| Embodied | Robotics + simulation control |
| Community | Content + signal management |

Principles: augmentation over automation · federated memory · transparent models.

## 🌍 External Adoption & Developer Ecosystem
HoneyDrunk.OS = **Public Creative Infrastructure.**  
> The Grid becomes the connective tissue of indie creation.

### Adoption Path
1. Internal validation (core nodes)  
2. Public SDK release (C#, TS, Unity/Unreal)  
3. Optional shared identity integration  
4. Paid cloud tiers (Pulse, Vault, AI orchestration)  
5. Federated “Hives” run by other studios

## 🧱 Governance & Licensing
- Core SDKs: open-source (MIT-style).  
- Hosted + orchestration layers: commercial license.  
- Governance: all nodes versioned + tracked in The Hive heartbeat.  
- Change control: public RFCs for major updates.

---

## 🧩 Developer Experience & Distribution
- Packages on **NuGet / NPM / GitHub Packages**.  
- Future dev portal: *developers.honeydrunkstudios.com*.  
- CLI: `hd` or `hivectl` for scaffolding nodes.  
- Template repos: Starter Node (SaaS, Game, Agent).

---

## 🔐 Data & Privacy Charter
- Creator data belongs to creators.  
- Metrics are anonymized and opt-in.  
- No resale, no hidden tracking.  
- XP and profiles sync only when users consent.

---

## ⚖️ AI Ethics & Oversight
1. Human-in-loop for all creative outputs.  
2. Agents must log actions + prompt context.  
3. Model transparency: declared model + version.  
4. Deterministic seeds for reproducibility.
