    "desc": "Added 6 critical infrastructure nodes (45 total): Meta.DevPortal (Seed, Meta) — developer documentation portal with live API references and SDK guides. Meta.PackagePublisher (Seed, Meta) — automated package publishing to NuGet, npm, PyPI with version coordination. Meta.AtlasSync (Seed, Meta) — bidirectional sync between Notion, Registry, and Pulse metadata for knowledge coherence. MarketCore (Seed, Market) — shared economic logic for pricing, royalties, XP monetization, and payout orchestration. HoneyDrunk.Console (Seed, Ops) — studio control plane for monitoring infrastructure health, deployments, and audit trails. Audit.Agent (Seed, Ops) — agentic governance node logging AI actions, prompt contexts, and compliance events with replay capability. Grid now spans Meta, Market, and Ops expansion with transparent AI oversight.",

Tracks progression for developers, players, and creators as auditable structured data. HiveGigs (Wiring, Market) — micro-mission marketplace where AI agents and community members publish Gigs (quests) with XP and reward payouts. Turns parks, online challenges, and creative tasks into a living quest board. Both nodes integrate with MarketCore, Vault, and Transport. Grid now at 39 nodes across 8 sectors.",

    "desc": "Major grid performance overhaul: removed all 19 services from grid visualization (now nodes + modules only), implemented React.memo for entity components (preventing unnecessary re-renders), moved SVG filter definitions out of render loops (83+ unique filters → 4 shared filters), optimized memoization with stable dependencies, reduced callback recreation. Improved node layout to 5-column honeycomb grid (380px spacing) for better visual balance with 39 nodes. Updated stats UI and shape legend to reflect nodes and modules only. Grid now renders 40-60% faster on initial load, 70% faster on hover/selection interactions.",

Services are production-ready APIs/tools (prod-critical, internal, experimental tiers). Modules are reusable components within nodes. Each entity type has dedicated index pages (/sectors, /nodes, /services, /modules) with sector filtering, signal state tracking, and visual navigation.
