    "desc": "Foundational module expansion: HoneyDrunk.Kernel.Abstractions added as the first Kernel module slot—defining core interfaces, contracts, and zero-dependency abstractions that underpin the entire Grid. Positioned as the 'contracts' slot with deep integration depth and stable tier, Abstractions establishes explicit boundaries between layers and provides dependency injection contracts for Vault, Transport, Telemetry, Pulse, and all Core modules. With signal=Live matching parent Kernel, this module represents the bedrock interface definitions now powering production infrastructure. Simultaneously promoted all three Transport adapter modules to Live: InMemory (shallow integration, dev/test harness), StorageQueues (medium integration, Azure queue adapter), and AzureServiceBus (deep integration, pub/sub with topics/sessions). These promotions reflect Transport's production-ready status across all supported messaging backends. Signal quote from Abstractions: 'The contracts that connect the Grid.' This work solidifies Kernel as the architectural foundation with explicit module slots while acknowledging Transport's maturity across in-memory, cloud queue, and enterprise service bus patterns.",

    "desc": "HoneyDrunk.Clarity (Flow: 24) joins the Grid as the AI sector's first human-facing companion—an in-studio guide wired directly into the Hive's intelligence. Clarity is context-aware across code editors, DCC tools (Blender, Photoshop), and game engines, providing precise answers rooted in HoneyDrunk.Kernel patterns, Standards rules, and Meta.AtlasSync knowledge. Unlike generic copilots, Clarity understands your active stack—repo, scene, file, task—and surfaces guidance from AgentKit, Pulse telemetry, Vault configs, and HoneyHub workflows in real time. Built for indie devs and small studios drowning in tabs and documentation, Clarity bridges tools through a single assistant surface: ask about C# best practices, Unity pipeline issues, or deployment flows without leaving your workspace. Phase 1 targets VS Code/JetBrains/VS extensions with HoneyDrunk-native intelligence; Phase 2 adds cross-tool overlays and team memory; Phase 3 couples with Operator/VEE for automated fixes. Dependencies: AgentKit (agent lifecycle), Pulse (context/telemetry), Vault (secure config), Meta.AtlasSync (synchronized knowledge), Standards (patterns), HoneyHub (task integration). Monetization path: core experience free or bundled with HoneyHub; Pro tiers for studios with private knowledge ingestion, org policies, multi-seat management, and telemetry insights. Signal quote: 'Know what to do next, wherever you are.' Clarity transforms the Grid from infrastructure into conversation.",

HoneyDrunk.Collector (Flow: 58) establishes telemetry ingestion with OTLP support, schema enforcement, and self-healing buffers—forming the inbound nerve ending feeding Pulse. HoneyDrunk.Comms (Flow: 55) unifies outbound notifications across email, push, SMS, and webhooks with templated delivery and Pulse-tracked reliability. HoneyDrunk.Assets (Flow: 57) provides centralized storage for digital artifacts with Vault encryption, signed URL delivery, and content-addressed versioning. All three nodes integrate deeply with existing infrastructure: depending on Vault for auth, Transport for event relay, and Pulse for metrics. Collector and Assets land in Ops and Core respectively, establishing foundation for observability SaaS and secure media delivery patterns. BuildLog component deployed to node detail pages, surfacing recent signals and updates for improved discoverability. Package updates applied: Next.js 16.0.0→16.0.1, React 19.1.0→19.2.0, Tailwind 4.1.14→4.1.17, @types/node upgraded ^20→^22 for Vercel compatibility.",

With standardized testing, packaging, and deployment pipelines, Actions bridges closed-source craft and open-source community.

Repository standardization applied: 16 nodes updated from lowercase slugs (e.g., /actions, /vault, /grid) to proper Pascal case (e.g., /HoneyDrunk.Actions, /HoneyDrunk.Vault, /HoneyDrunk.Grid) for consistency with naming conventions.

Simultaneously overhauled flow cooldown mechanics to dramatically deprioritize completed work: (1) Cooldown multipliers reduced from 0.6/0.8 to 0.02/0.05 for priority/energy, applying 98% penalty to done nodes. (2) Implemented hard cap system in compute-flow.js — any done node automatically capped at Flow ≤ 45 regardless of centrality or foundational status. (3) Foundational floor guardrail disabled (percentile: 70 → 0) to prevent lifting completed nodes. (4) Kernel and Standards both dropped from Flow 73 to 45, clearing space for active development. (5) Adjusted Transport (strategy_base: 28, Awake), Data (strategy_base: 26, Awake), and Vault (strategy_base: 15, Awake) to establish clear 2nd/3rd/4th priority positions (Flow: 90/86/80). Flow Index now accurately reflects active roadmap: Actions (94), Transport (90), Data (86), Vault (80) lead active work, while completed Kernel and Standards sit at 45.

(2) Reset all signals to reflect current state: 45 nodes → Seed (except Standards/Wiring and Grid/Live), 18 services → Seed (except Grid.Visualizer/Live), 25 modules → Seed. Removed all module status_dot fields (beta/alpha/experimental markers irrelevant in planning phase). (3) Fixed FlowLanes component to use flow_tiers.json instead of hardcoded tiers—replaced \"archived\" with correct \"future\" tier. (4) Fixed Echo signal visibility in /grid filters and legend (was missing due to incomplete signal list from entities). (5) Fixed hexagon click navigation on /grid while preserving drag-to-reposition behavior—moved click detection from onClick to mouseUp with 10px drag threshold. Flow recomputed: Standards (Flow: 96, Priority: 100, Energy: 89) now anchors the Grid as the discipline layer.

Ancestor override now works on the acyclic SCC DAG, with smart normalization inside cycles (foundational nodes get maxPriority - 5, others equalize). Updated 10 key nodes with tuned time_pressure and strategy_base parameters. Results: Kernel (100) and Vault (100) now anchor the top, Transport (85) and Web.Rest (82) follow as foundational, Pipelines (80) holds reasonable position.
